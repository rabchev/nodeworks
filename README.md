Nodeworks
=========
Nodeworks is an open source IDE for Node.js applications based on [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) project.
The IDE uses client-server model over HTTP, where the client is a standard web browser.
Nodeworks is designed to be an IDE for remote and collaborative application developmen,
but it can be used, just as well, on stand-alone machines.
